# 🌿 ViSAGE 1.0 |

*A transparent, gravity‑based modelling framework for analysing greenspace visitation and development impacts.*

ViSAGE (Visitation Simulation and Greenspace Evaluation) is a reproducible spatial modelling framework designed to help planners, researchers and environmental agencies understand how people interact with greenspace networks — and how new developments reshape demand.

This repository contains the core ViSAGE 1.0 model used for the Oxford North case study and for the associated Landscape & Urban Planning manuscript.

## 🔍 What ViSAGE does |

- Models greenspace visitation using a gravity‑based approach  
- Integrates a **quality‑based attractiveness** extension
- Generates **origin–destination flows** between population centres and greenspaces  
- Supports **scenario testing**, including new developments and network changes  
- Produces clear, reproducible outputs including the signature **baseline–scenario–difference triptych**

## ⚙️ How the model works (conceptually) |

1. **Load and prepare data**  
   Origins, destinations and networks are aligned, cleaned and normalised.

2. **Apply gravity model**  
   Distance decay and attractiveness weights generate visitation probabilities.

3. **Integrate quality attractor**  
   Greenspace quality modifies destination attractiveness (ViSAGE 1.0 feature).

4. **Build OD matrix**  
   Flows are computed between each origin–destination pair.

5. **Run scenarios**  
   Baseline and development scenarios (e.g., Oxford North) are executed.

6. **Generate outputs**  
   Maps, triptychs and summary tables are exported for analysis.

## 🚀 Running ViSAGE 1.0 |

A full “How to run ViSAGE 1.0” guide is provided in  
`paper/how_to_run_visage.md` (or will be added shortly).

In brief:

1. Place your input data in `data/`  
2. Adjust parameters in `scripts/00_setup/parameters.py`  
3. Run a scenario script, e.g.:

```bash
python scripts/02_scenarios/run_baseline.py
python scripts/02_scenarios/run_oxford_north.py

```
